# Basic starter site

Basic starter site (based off 11ty Sass Skeleton created by by [@5t3ph](https://twitter.com/5t3ph)).

I've stripped the styles down but left references to more opinionated styles commented out of `main.scss`.

Everything below from the original 11ty Sass Skeleton README 👇.


## Development Scripts

**`npm start`**

> Run 11ty with hot reload at localhost:8080, including reload based on Sass changes

**`npm run build`**

> Production build includes minified, autoprefixed CSS

Use this as the "Publish command" if needed by hosting such as Netlify.
