# 11ty Starter

Simple 11ty starter site with some Nunjuck macros pretending to be components. Some _mildly_ opinionated style rules but pretty basic.

## First steps

1. Update the 'name' and 'description' in `package.json`.
2. **IMPORTANT** Update the repository.URL in `package.json` to point to your newly created one.
3. run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

## Running

> npm start
